# Quando Privacy Policy

Thank you for choosing Quando! This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our service. By using Quando, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

## Collection of Data

Blue is a free service, and we do not charge any fees for its use. We collect certain data to provide and improve our service. The data we collect includes:

- Server IDs: We collect server IDs to manage server-specific settings such as self-roles, anti-nuke measures, giveaways, welcome messages, and member information. This data is stored securely using AES encryption standards.

## Use of Data

We do not use or share your information with any third parties. The data collected is solely used for providing and enhancing the Quando service. The terms used in this Privacy Policy are in accordance with our Terms and Conditions, unless otherwise specified.

## Message Monitoring

Quando monitors messages to enforce automated moderation features such as automod, anti-blacklist system, anti-nuke measures, and main role assignments. This is done to maintain a safe and enjoyable environment within Discord servers.

## Access to Server Data

Access to server data is limited to server owners and administrators. Additionally, bot developers have access to all data for maintenance and improvement purposes.

## Data Storage and Retention

We store server data, including configurations and blacklisted user IDs, for up to 7 days after the bot is removed from a Discord server. This allows for seamless reconfiguration if the bot is re-added within that timeframe. If you wish to have your data removed permanently, you may request it from the developer.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us through our support server: [Quando Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/3sBrPXzC8Y).

Thank you for entrusting Quando with your data. We are committed to maintaining your privacy and providing a secure service.
